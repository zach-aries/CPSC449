## Assignment Overview

### Sample Solution Length:
About 80 lines (in addition to the provided code) without any comments

### Background:
A quad tree is a data structure that can be used to store data with a two-dimensional structure to it,
such as an image. As the name suggests, a quad tree has internal nodes that have exactly four children.
Each leaf node contains data for the region that it represents, such as the color of the region within an
image. When an image contains large homogenous regions a quad tree can be a spatially efficient
mechanism for representing an image (however, when the image doesn’t contain such regions a quad
tree isn’t an efficient representation). While quad trees can be used to represent rectangular regions,
we will confine ourselves to square images where the width and height of the image are powers of 2 so
that the number of special cases that need to be considered is kept to a minimum.

### Part 1:
Define a recursive algebraic type for a quad tree. The base case will be a leaf node that contains an (Int,
Int, Int) tuple where the first Int represents an amount of red, the second represents and amount of
green and the third represents an amount of blue. Each color level will be a value between 0 and 255.
The recursive case is an internal node that has four children. No data is stored in the internal nodes.
Define a second algebraic type for an image that consists of an integer and a quad tree. The integer will
represent the width (and height) of the image (since it is square) and the quad tree will contain the color
data for the image.

### Part 2:
I have provided code that loads a PNG image file and stores it in a two dimension lists. The two
dimensional list has one entry in it for each pixel in the image. Each pixel is represented by an (Int, Int,
Int) tuple consisting of the red, green and blue components of the pixel. The type of such an image is
[[(Int, Int, Int)]].
Write a function named createTree that takes a list representation of an image and stores it in a quad
tree image. Your function will take one parameter of type [[(Int, Int, Int)]], and it will return one result
that is a quad tree image (the second type that you defined in Part 1 consisting of both the image’s
width and the tree). Your function should report an error (and quit your program) if the provided image
is not square.
Hint: A general approach that works for solving this problem is to examine the current image. If it’s
homogenous, meaning that all of the pixels are the same color, then create a leaf node of that color.
Otherwise, break the image into 4 smaller square sub-images (all of which will have the same size) and
construct an internal node by recursively constructing four child nodes for the four smaller sub-images.

### Part 3:
Write a function named treeMap that maps a function over all of the nodes in a quad tree, returning the
modified quad tree as its result. The treeMap function will take a function, f, as its first parameter, and
it will take a quad tree, q, as its second parameter. The function f will take a quad tree as its only
parameter, returning a quad tree as its result.
Create a function named grayscale that converts an image to gray scale (by averaging the red, green and
blue values in each leaf node and then using that average value for all three color components). Create
a second function named mirror that mirrors the image (left and right are swapped). Each of these
transformations must be implemented by mapping a function over the quad tree using your treeMap
function. A image stored in a quad tree can be mirrored by changing the order of the children for each
non-leaf node while leaving the leaf nodes unchanged. A grayscale image can be created by modifying
the values in leaf nodes while leaving the non-leaf nodes unchanged.

### Part 4:
Write a function named toHTML that generates the HTML SVG tags necessary to render a quad tree
representation of an image in a browser. To do this, traverse your tree so that you visit every leaf node
and generate a <rect> tag for each leaf node that fills the correct region with the correct color. The
order in which the tags are generated is not important because none of the rectangles that you are
generating should overlap.

### For an Additional Challenge:
Extend your implementation so that it correctly handles rectangular images of arbitrary width and
height (you can no longer assume that the width and height are the same, or that they are powers of 2).
You’ll need to change the algebraic type defined in Part 1 so that the type that stores the image includes
the width and height, along with the implementations of your functions for working with a quad tree
representation of an image when completing this part of the assignment.
